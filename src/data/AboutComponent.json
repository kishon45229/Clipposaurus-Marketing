    "description": "Clipposaurus is an open-source project built with a clear purpose: to create software people can trust. We are not driven by profit, ads, or data collection. Instead, we focus on building reliable tools that respect user privacy, remain transparent by design, and solve real-world problems. Every line of code is open, security is a priority, and our decisions are guided by what benefits the community—not shareholders.",
