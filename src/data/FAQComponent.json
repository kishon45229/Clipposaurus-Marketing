      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "What is Clipposaurus?",
          "answer": "Clipposaurus is a secure, temporary content sharing platform that allows you to create drops containing text and code snippets across devices. It uses end-to-end encryption and automatically deletes your content based on your chosen retention setting (up to 1 hour), ensuring your privacy and security."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to create an account?",
          "answer": "No! Clipposaurus works without any registration or login. Simply add your content, get your drop key, and share them with anyone who needs access. This approach ensures maximum privacy and convenience."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does it cost?",
          "answer": "Clipposaurus is completely free to use. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or premium tiers. We believe in providing secure content sharing accessible to everyone."
        },
        {
          "question": "What types of content can I share?",
          "answer": "You can create drops containing two types of content: plain text (notes, messages, etc.) and code snippets with syntax highlighting for 10+ programming languages."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long is my drop stored?",
          "answer": "Your drop is automatically deleted based on the retention setting you choose when creating it: immediately after being accessed, after 30 minutes, or after 1 hour. This ensures your sensitive information doesn't remain on our servers longer than necessary."
        }

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Is my content encrypted?",
          "answer": "Yes! All content is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption before being stored. Your content is encrypted on our servers and can only be decrypted using your drop Key."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can Clipposaurus staff access my content?",
          "answer": "No. Your content is encrypted before storage, and we don't have access to the decryption keys. Only someone with your drop Key can decrypt and access your content."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens when my drop expires?",
          "answer": "Your content is automatically and permanently deleted from our servers. This includes all text, code and associated metadata. There is no backup or recovery option."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you track or log user activity?",
          "answer": "We use minimal analytics (Vercel Analytics) to understand usage demands and improve the service. We don't track individual users. We don't use cookies for tracking or advertising."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Clipposaurus GDPR and CCPA compliant?",
          "answer": "Yes. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations. Since drop is automatically deleted after maximum 1 hour and we don't store personal information, our service is designed with privacy by default."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where is my data stored?",
          "answer": "Text and code are stored in encrypted Upstash Redis databases."

      "description": "How to use the platform effectively",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How do I create a drop?",
          "answer": "Simply paste or upload your content, click 'Create Drop', and you'll receive a unique drop key. Share this key with anyone who needs access. They can then visit Clipposaurus, enter the key, and instantly access your content."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is a drop key?",
          "answer": "A drop key is a unique three-word code (like 'apple-beer-ocean') that unlocks your content. It's short enough to say out loud in person or text quickly—way easier than copying long random URLs. Think of it like a verbal password you can share at a meeting or coffee shop."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I access my content multiple times?",
          "answer": "It depends on what you choose! Pick 'delete after first access' for ultra-secure one-time sharing (perfect for sensitive info). Or choose 30 minutes or 1 hour if you're sharing with a group and want everyone to grab it before it vanishes. You're always in control."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I lose my drop key?",
          "answer": "Unfortunately, if you lose your drop key, there's no way to recover your content. The key is the only way to decrypt and access your data. We recommend saving it immediately or keeping the browser tab open."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I share my drop key with multiple people?",
          "answer": "Absolutely! If you set the timer to 30 minutes or 1 hour, you can share the three-word key with your whole team. Everyone who has it can access the content before it expires—great for quick team handoffs, meeting notes, or sharing code snippets with colleagues in the same room."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I edit content after saving it?",
          "answer": "No. Once drop is created, it cannot be edited. If you need to make changes, you'll need to create a new drop with the updated content and a new drop key."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a limit to how much I can share?",
          "answer": "No limitations for text and code sharing. However, excessive usage may be subject to rate limiting to ensure fair access for all users."

          "answer": "We support syntax highlighting for over 10 programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Go, Rust, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Swift, Kotlin, and many more. You can copy the code with formatting preserved and syntax highlighting"
        },
        {
          "question": "What encryption algorithm do you use?",
          "answer": "We use AES-256 encryption, which is the industry standard for data encryption. This is the same level of encryption used by banks and government agencies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is the source code open source?",
          "answer": "Yes, it is open source! You can find the source code on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/kishon45229/clipposaurus."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have an API?",
          "answer": "Not at the moment. We're focused on perfecting the web interface first. An API for developers may be considered in future updates based on user demand."

      "description": "Common issues and their solutions",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Why can't I access my drop?",
          "answer": "Common reasons include: 1) Content has expired (depending on your retention setting: after access, 30 minutes, or 1 hour), 2) Drop key was entered incorrectly (check for typos), 3) Network connectivity issues. Make sure you're entering the exact drop key provided when you created the drop."
        },
        {
          "question": "The page is loading slowly. How can I fix this?",
          "answer": "Slow loading can be caused by: 1) Poor internet connection, 2) Browser extensions interfering. Try disabling browser extensions, checking your connection speed, or using a different network."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I extend the expiration time beyond 1 hour?",
          "answer": "No. For security reasons, drops cannot be kept longer than 1 hour. However, you can choose shorter retention periods when creating your drop: delete immediately after access, after 30 minutes, or after 1 hour. If you need to keep content accessible longer, you'll need to create a new drop before the current one expires."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why am I seeing an error message?",
          "answer": "Error messages usually indicate: content expiration, invalid drop key, network issues, or server problems. Try refreshing the page, checking your internet connection, or creating a new drop. If the problem persists, the issue may be on our end and we're likely working on it."

        },
        {
          "question": "Does Clipposaurus work offline?",
          "answer": "No. Clipposaurus requires an internet connection to  create and open drop. However, once you've accessed accessed your drop, you can copy it locally for offline use."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I password-protect my content?",
          "answer": "The drop key serves as your password. Since it's required to access the content and is unique to each share, your content is already protected. Only those with the drop key can access it."
        },
